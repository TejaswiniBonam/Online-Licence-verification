The Online License and Vehicle Verification System is a web-based application designed to streamline the process of 
verifying vehicle and license-related documents for traffic enforcement authorities. Instead of relying on physical 
paperwork, this application allows traffic police to access a userâ€™s license and vehicle documents digitally in real time.
